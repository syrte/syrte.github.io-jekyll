My research is focused on the dynamics and formation of cosmic structures, from the local group to distant galaxy clusters. I'm curious about how the structures are shaped into their current status, and in reverse how we can learn about the initial condition, formation history and physics therein from present observations, especially the dynamics. To explore these questions, I mainly use the simulations and statistics to bridge the theory and observation.
