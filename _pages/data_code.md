### Data

- [**Milky Way mass profile and satellite kinematics**](https://github.com/syrte/mw_sats_kin)  
  Supplementary data tables for [arxiv:1912.02086](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...894...10L)  
  The repository includes four table files, including the inferred MW mass profile and its covariance matrix, the original measurements and the posterior kinematics of MW satellite galaxies.
