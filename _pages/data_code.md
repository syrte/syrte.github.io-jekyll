### Tools

- [**handy**](https://github.com/syrte/handy): Personal Python library for statistics, computation, and plotting.
<!-- Functions that are missed in Scipy and Matplotlib. -->
- [**fortio**](https://github.com/syrte/fortio): A Python IO for Fortran Unformatted Binary Files with Variable-Length Records.
- [**cyper**](https://github.com/syrte/cyper): Cython performed inline: compile and run your Cython snippets on the fly.
- [**robustgp**](https://github.com/syrte/robustgp): Robust Gaussian process [coming soon].
- [*ndtest*](https://github.com/syrte/ndtest): Multi-dimensional statistical test with python
- [*scitextool*](https://github.com/syrte/scitextool): Some routines for the preparation of astronomy paper submissions.

I have also contributed *un petit peu* to various open source projects, including Numpy, Scipy, Cython, [adstex](https://github.com/yymao/adstex), [sharedmem](https://github.com/rainwoodman/sharedmem).

### Data

- [**Milky Way mass profile and satellite kinematics**](https://github.com/syrte/mw_sats_kin)  
  Supplementary data tables for [arxiv:1912.02086](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...894...10L)  
  The repository includes four table files, including the inferred MW mass profile and its covariance matrix, the original measurements and the posterior kinematics of MW satellite galaxies.
