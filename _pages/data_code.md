### Tools

- [**handy**](https://github.com/syrte/handy): My personal Python library for statistics, computation and plotting. Functions that are missed in scipy and matplotlib.

- [**fortio**](https://github.com/syrte/fortio): A Python IO for Fortran Unformatted Binary Files with Variable-Length Records.

- [**cyper**](https://github.com/syrte/cyper): Cython performed inline: compile and run your Cython snippets on the fly.

- [**robustgp**](https://github.com/syrte/robustgp): Robust Gaussian process [coming soon].

- [*ndtest*](https://github.com/syrte/ndtest): Multi-dimensional statistical test with python

- [*scitextool*](https://github.com/syrte/scitextool): Some routines for the preparation of astronomy paper submissions.


I have also contributed *un petit peu* to multiple open source projects, including Numpy, Scipy, Cython, [adstex](https://github.com/yymao/adstex), [sharedmem](https://github.com/rainwoodman/sharedmem).

### Data

#### [**Milky Way mass profile and satellite kinematics**](https://github.com/syrte/mw_sats_kin)

  Supplementary data tables for arxiv:1912.02086

  The repository includes four table files, including
  the inferred MW mass profile and its covariance matrix,
  the original measurements and the posterior kinematics of MW satellite galaxies.
